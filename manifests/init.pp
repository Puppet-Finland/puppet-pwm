#
# == Class: pwm
#
# A Puppet module for managing Pwm:
#
# <https://code.google.com/p/pwm>
#
# Note that the module expects to find pwm.war at the root of the Puppet 
# fileserver. This could be avoided if Pwm was packaged for Debian.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*manage*]
#   Manage Pwm with Puppet. Valid values are 'yes' (default) and 'no'.
# [*manage_config*]
#   Manage Pwm configuration with Puppet. Valid values are 'yes' (default) and 
#   'no'.
# [*dirsrv_type*]
#   Directory server type. Currently only '389ds' is supported. The default 
#   value is 'none', which means that auto-configuration of schemas is omitted.
